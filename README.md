# E-Chess

This project is a physical chess board that is connected to an online chess server (currently lichess).  
It allows to play chess on a physical board with a computer/remote opponent.

It is currently **WIP** so no full documentation and information is available yet.  
However there exists already a working prototype including:
* ESP32-S3 Rust firmware
* web interface
* (simple) ota update
* connection to lichess (via esp32 wifi)
* initial hotspot for wifi setup
* LEDs in the board to show the current game state
* 3d printable OpenSCAD file
* KiCAD electronics schematic
